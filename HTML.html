        <p> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.
            HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was 
            published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 
            version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and 
            this version was published in 2012.

    <h1> HTML Element </h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it 
            ends with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash as shown 
            below with few tags −

    <h1> Heading Tags </h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. 
            HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements < h1>, < h2>, < h3>, < h4>, 
                < h5>, and < h6>. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and 
                    one line after that heading.

    <h1> Attribute </h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside 
            the element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value

The name is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph <p> element in the example carries 
    an attribute whose name is align, which you can use to indicate the alignment of paragraph on the page.
The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations. The below 
example shows three possible values of align attribute: left, center and right.

    <h1> HTML Forms </h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            HTML Forms are required, when you want to collect some data from the site visitor. For example, during
             user registration you would like to collect information such as name, email address, credit card, etc.

A form will take input from the site visitor and then will post it to a back-end application such as CGI, ASP Script
 or PHP script etc. The back-end application will perform required processing on the passed data based on defined business 
 logic inside the application.

There are various form elements available like text fields, textarea fields, drop-down menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.

The HTML <form> tag is used to create an HTML form and it has following syntax −

<form action = "Script URL" method = "GET|POST">
   form elements like input, textarea etc.
</form> 
        <em><div>

    <h1> Meta Tag </h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            HTML lets you specify metadata - additional important information about a document in a variety of ways. The META 
            elements can be used to include name/value pairs describing properties of the HTML document, such as author, expiry 
            date, a list of keywords, document author etc.

The <meta> tag is used to provide such additional information. This tag is an empty element and so does not have a closing tag 
but it carries information within its attributes.

                <caption>Table with 2px solid borders</caption>
                <tr>

                    <td>1</td>
                    <td><strong>Name</strong>

                        Name for the property. Can be anything. Examples include, keywords, description, author, revised, generator etc.</td>

                    <td>4</td>
                    <td><strong>http-equiv</strong>

                        Used for http response message headers. For example, http-equiv can be used to refresh the page or 
                        to set a cookie. Values include content-type, expires, refresh and set-cookie.</td>
